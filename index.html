            <h3 class="content maroon">I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student, studying Data Science at UC Berkeley. I'm projected to graduate in Spring 2024 and I'm ultimately looking to take my skills and apply it directly to industry as soon as I graduate. Outside of academics, some of my hobbies include playing volleyball, playing video games, and riding motorcycles.</h3>

        <h3 class="content maroon">In order to honor the University of California, Berkeley and its Academic Code of Student Conduct, I will simply list the names and vague descriptions of the projects that I've completed. I wouldn't want to get in trouble by posting my past solutions after all!</h3>
        <ol class="content black">
            <li>Gitlet</li>
                <p class="black">This is a project that I completed in Summer 2022. This project is the infamous one that defines CS61B at UC Berkeley. It requires us to create our own file structure and develop a working clone of the industry standard Git version-control system. My implementation of Gitlet utilizes a lot of HashMaps and file persistence.</p>
            <li>Build Your Own World (BYOW)</li>
                <p class="black">This is a project that I also completed in Summer 2022. This was my second favorite project. It requires us to design and implement a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. This project especially stood out to me because it was interactable. The resulting product is able to take any user inputted seed, and use it to produce a world that's unique to that seed. The player is then able to move an avatar around the map and traverse collecting coins. The players also have the option to load a previous save or create a new game. This project was the culmination of world generation algorithms, interactivity, and overall a lot of creative coding fun!</p>
